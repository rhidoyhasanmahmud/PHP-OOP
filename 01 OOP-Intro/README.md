> OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

> Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code.

> Class and Object:

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

Class  - Fruits 
Object - Apple, Banana, Mango

So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties.
